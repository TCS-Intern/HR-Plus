**Re: Machine Learning Engineer Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Machine Learning Engineer position at Telentic. As a Research Engineer at OpenAI with a Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon, I have spent my career pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI. I am now eager to apply this expertise to transform how companies discover and evaluate talent.

**Why This Role Excites Me:**

Telentic's approach to using AI for hiring presents fascinating technical challenges that align perfectly with my background:

1. **Resume Parsing & Understanding:** My NLP expertise, including work on multilingual models at Meta serving 1B+ users, directly applies to extracting meaning from diverse resume formats.

2. **Video Interview Analysis:** My experience with multimodal AI and computer vision at OpenAI positions me well to build systems that can assess candidate responses fairly and accurately.

3. **Matching & Ranking:** Building recommendation systems—like those I developed at Meta for content understanding—translates directly to matching candidates with opportunities.

**My Background:**

At OpenAI, I've contributed to GPT-4's training infrastructure and built evaluation pipelines for model assessment. This experience has given me deep expertise in:

- Large-scale distributed training across 10k+ GPUs
- Building production ML systems with strict latency requirements
- Designing evaluation frameworks for AI systems
- Ensuring model safety and reducing bias

Previously at Meta, I led the NLP team building content understanding models. We deployed multilingual classification models with 95% accuracy across 50 languages—experience directly applicable to processing resumes and job descriptions globally.

**My Publications:**

My research has been published at top venues including NeurIPS and ACL, with a focus on efficient training and inference of large language models. I hold 3 patents on ML optimization techniques.

**Why Telentic:**

I'm drawn to Telentic because you're tackling a problem that matters. Hiring is often biased, inefficient, and frustrating for everyone involved. The opportunity to apply cutting-edge ML to make this process more fair and effective is exactly the kind of impact I want to have.

I would be thrilled to discuss how my background in NLP, production ML, and research can accelerate Telentic's mission. Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

David Kim, Ph.D.
