**Re: Senior Software Engineer Position**

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Software Engineer position at Telentic. With 7 years of experience building scalable distributed systems at companies like Stripe and Google, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your AI-powered hiring platform.

**Why Telentic:**

The intersection of AI and recruiting is fascinating to me. Having gone through countless interview processes at top tech companies, I've seen firsthand how broken and inconsistent hiring can be. Telentic's mission to bring intelligence and fairness to talent acquisition resonates deeply with my own experiences. I believe technology can make hiring better for both companies and candidates.

**What I Bring:**

At Stripe, I lead the payments API team where I designed and implemented a rate-limiting system handling 10M+ requests daily. This experience directly translates to building the high-performance backend systems Telentic needs:

- **Scale:** I've built systems serving millions of users with 99.99% uptime
- **Python Expertise:** 7 years of professional Python experience, which aligns with your tech stack
- **Leadership:** I currently lead a team of 4 engineers and have mentored 6 junior developers
- **System Design:** Extensive experience architecting distributed systems and APIs

Prior to Stripe, I worked at Google Cloud Platform where I contributed to Cloud Functions and Cloud Run. This gave me deep experience with serverless architectures and cloud infrastructure—skills that would be valuable as Telentic scales.

**Why Me:**

Beyond technical skills, I bring a collaborative mindset and genuine passion for the problem you're solving. I've reviewed hundreds of resumes and conducted dozens of interviews—I understand the pain points in hiring from both sides. I want to help build tools that make this process more efficient and equitable.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience can contribute to Telentic's success. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Sarah Chen
